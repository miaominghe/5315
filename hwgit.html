      <h2>a.  What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>Git is the most widely used modern version control system today, and it is an actively maintained open source project. It is originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. We need version control because it reduces the possibilities of error creation when collaborating with teammates on the same set of files. With version control, everyone on the team can work on any file at any time without concerning about error and overwriting. The version control system will also merge all changes into a common version at the end.</p>

      <h2>b1. Local Repository </h2>
      <p>The local repository is located on our computers and contains all the files and their commit history, history review, and committing when offline. It contains full repository history locally.</p>

      <h2>b2. Remote Repository</h2>
      <p>The remote repository is optional, but it is useful for teamwork. Usually, members in a team will work on a codebase together which allows people to retrieve files and commit. The codebase will be located on a central server which is not on the physical machine of individual. It is shared by the team, and team member needs to push commits onto the remote repository to share with the team.</p>

      <h2>b3. How to use GIT in Team Project</h2>
      <p>A great way to use GIT in team project is to create a remote repository for the team, and each member has a local repository. Then, the team set up branches on the remote repository that each member will work on them locally. When team members finish making changes, they can push the commit to the remote repository and GIT will help the team merge all updates into a common file. GIT allows team members to work on their parts freely and take care of the merging part which will significantly reduce the error and info duplications in the merging process.</p>

      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool that use containers to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications. It’s similar to the virtual machine, but it doesn’t need to create the entire virtual operating system. Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they are running on and only requires applications to ship with things not already running on the host computer. It is open source so that everyone can contribute to Docker and extend more features as needed. - Source: https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker</p>
      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>NGINX is an open source software that can be used for web serving, caching, load balancing, reverse proxying, media streaming, and more. It has HTTP server, proxy server and reverse proxy capabilities. It consistently beats other servers in web server performance. It can handle a high volume of connections which allows it to be used as a reverse proxy and load balancer to manage the traffic. - Source: https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/</p>
      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a software that behaves like an actual computer. It can run programs and perform tasks like a computer. It is separated from the rest of the computer system which means that the software inside the VM can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. It is ideal for testing other operating systems and running software on operating systems that they weren’t originally intended for. Multiple VMs can run on the same computer at the same time. It saves costs on purchasing hardware systems as well as the maintenance costs for such hardware systems. - Source: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/</p>
      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>DigitalOcean, as a cloud computing vendor, offers the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) platform for software developers. Generally, users start with launching a virtual machine which calls “droplet” in DigitalOcean. DigitalOceans offer droplets in various sizes and developers can manage their droplets using a control panel and an open source API. Developers can cooperate as a team in DigitalOcean. DigitalOcean is a quick and efficient way for developers to create without costing significantly on hardware. - Source: https://www.digitalocean.com/about/ and https://searchcloudcomputing.techtarget.com/definition/DigitalOcean</p>
